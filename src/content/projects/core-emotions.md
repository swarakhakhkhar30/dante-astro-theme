## The idea

Core Emotions is a journey into the trippy world of human emotions and personality. You'll explore where feelings like joy, sadness, and anger come from , how they influence the things we do and how they influence our personality. As you wander through, you'll gain some insights into how life events shape who you are over time. 

## Outcome

Psycho-educate audience on what does it mean to feel a certain emotion, what makes life moments significant and how is oneâ€™s personality built. This project could serve as a platform for instructing children in the development of socio-emotional competencies.
